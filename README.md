RefleXle is a Wordle-inspired logic game.
It adds a twist: you don’t type guesses, you analyze feedback patterns to deduce the hidden word logically.

🧠 Concept
In each round:
You’re shown a fixed guess word (e.g. CRANE).
You choose a feedback pattern (using colored tiles for Black, Yellow, Green).
Based on your pattern, the system evaluates your logic and progresses to the next round.
After up to 5 rounds, you get a chance to guess the hidden word directly.
The fewer rounds you take, the higher your score!
